# Cool-Visualizations

This is where I keep the codes for my combination charts.

<h2>1) Bar chart with two variables in x-axis and custom annotations showing the change in each bar</h2>

You can use this code for:
* Bar chart with two variables in x-axis
* Custom annotations showing change for comparison

In this part of code, we will show how to create a bar chart with two variables in x-axis so that the bars related to each variable are separated by a different color. We will also have custom annotations that show the difference between bars of each category. For example, the annotations could show the difference in sales from one year to another.<br><br>
