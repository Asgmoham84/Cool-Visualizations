# Cool-Visualizations
This is where I keep the codes for my combination charts.

1) Bar chart with two variables in x-axis and annotations showing the change in each bar

This is a good way to compare two values for each category, for example showing the change in the sales in different fruits in 2019 compare to 2018.
I use this chart at work to show the reduction we were able to make in the usage on some unnecessary drugs in a year compared to previous year.
